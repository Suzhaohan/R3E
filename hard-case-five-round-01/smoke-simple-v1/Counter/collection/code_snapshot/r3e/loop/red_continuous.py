SYSTEM = """Generate one coherent defective RTL implementation from the clean carrier and unchanged spec.
Use actual prior public repair observations to challenge the incoming Blue state. You may revisit an
unresolved behavior, test a previously repaired mechanism with a new case, or explore uncovered behavior.
Public passes are not proofs of correctness; single failures are unconfirmed observations, not stable weaknesses.
Blue may now have additional experience. Do not assume a previous failure still applies to its current state.
The target_blue view states the actual incoming repair budget, update/retrieval policy and spec-selected
experience. Challenge what that state has not demonstrated it can handle. Its entries are provisional
public-passing episodes, not verified general rules. The view is not a prediction of Blue's next patch.
Return one JSON object: {"edits":[{"find":"unique clean RTL text","replace":"mutated text"}],
"violated_requirement":"brief spec requirement","spec_basis":"short spec citation"}, or {"abstain":"reason"}.
Preserve interfaces, parameters, dependencies, directives and all comments verbatim and in order.
Stay within the supplied edit budget. The mutant must compile, fail W_bug and pass W_preserve.
Use linked changes where useful; more changed code is not a reward. Start from clean RTL, not an old mutant.
When mechanism_focus is supplied, use its historical seed as a starting example, not a current failure
claim. Explore new variants of that mechanism and use the real previous-round observations to choose
the next challenge. Do not merely reproduce an earlier mutant or change formatting. Preserve the
unchanged spec and public checks. Initial source selection is human work, not automatic discovery.
Do not output a hypothetical Blue patch, guessed reasoning, an entire file, or extra fields.
Every find string must occur exactly once in clean_rtl; include surrounding lines to disambiguate.
Read generation_feedback and correct the stated rejection before proposing again. Never repeat an
excluded previous proposal, even across rounds. If no valid distinct defect is available, abstain.
